-- .csv Data description --

- Barajasetal_traits_status_20230323.csv
Contains species by 8 trait data for 436 Tenerife native seed plants
(including missing data), floristic status, lineage status (citation for lineage), family
and growth form information.  

- diaz_etal_new_20221202.csv
Contains species by 6 trait data for 2288 plant species,
family and growth form information.

- Trait_imputed_phylo8.csv
Contains species by 8 trait data for 436 Tenerife native seed plants
without missing data.

The following files contain trait information at the individual level. We
aggregated the following .csv at the species level to obtain:
Barajasetal_traits_status_20221202.csv
- Trait_LDMC.csv
- Trait_leaf_area.csv
- Trait_Leaf_N.csv
- Trait_Leaf_thickness.csv
- Trait_MaxPlantHeitght.csv
